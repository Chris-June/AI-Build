# Theme Directory

## Purpose:
The `theme` folder within the `styles` directory is responsible for managing the theming and styling configurations of our AI-based web application. This directory centralizes all color schemes, typography settings, spacing guidelines, and other design tokens that define the visual identity of the application. By organizing these settings in one place, we ensure a consistent look and feel across the entire application, making it easier to maintain and extend the design system.

## Contents:
- **Color Variables:** Files that define the primary, secondary, and accent colors used throughout the application. These color variables are used to maintain a consistent color scheme and can be easily adjusted to change the application's theme or branding.

- **Typography Settings:** Files that define the font families, sizes, weights, and line heights used across the application. These settings ensure that text is styled consistently, improving readability and visual hierarchy.

- **Spacing and Layout:** Files that manage spacing units, such as margins, padding, and grid layouts. By centralizing these settings, we ensure that the application maintains a coherent and balanced layout across different components and pages.

- **Dark and Light Themes:** Files that manage the settings for dark and light mode themes. These themes allow users to switch between different visual modes, enhancing the user experience and accessibility.

- **Theming Utilities:** Helper functions or mixins that allow for dynamic theming, such as calculating shades and tints or applying responsive design principles. These utilities make it easier to implement and extend the theme throughout the application.

- **Instructional Guides:** Documents that explain how to use and extend the theme settings within this directory. These guides provide step-by-step instructions for applying theme variables to components, customizing the theme, and maintaining consistency across the application.

## How to Use:
1. **Review Theme Settings:** Familiarize yourself with the existing color variables, typography settings, and spacing guidelines in this directory. Understanding these settings is essential for maintaining consistency in your component and page designs.

2. **Apply Theme Variables:** When styling components, use the theme variables defined in this directory instead of hardcoding values. This ensures that your components adhere to the application's design system and can easily adapt to theme changes.

3. **Customize the Theme:** If you need to create a new theme or adjust the existing one, modify the files in this directory. This might include adding new color variables, adjusting typography settings, or creating new spacing units. Ensure that any changes are documented and applied consistently across the application.

4. **Implement Dark and Light Modes:** Use the files in this directory to manage dark and light themes. Implement the necessary logic to allow users to switch between themes, and ensure that all components respond correctly to theme changes.

5. **Follow the Guides:** Refer to the instructional guides within this directory to ensure you're using theme settings effectively and following best practices. The guides will help you understand how to maintain a cohesive and adaptable design system.

6. **Contribute Back:** If you develop new theme settings or utilities that could benefit the project, contribute them back to this directory. This helps maintain a centralized approach to theming and promotes consistency across the application.

## Next Steps:
- Familiarize yourself with the current theme settings and their use cases.
- Use the guides to help implement and extend the theme in your components and layouts.
- Consult your mentor or project lead if you need further clarification or assistance.

Create a consistent and adaptable design system with centralized theme management!
