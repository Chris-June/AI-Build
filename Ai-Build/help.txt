Intellisync AI Build Project Documentation

Project Overview:

	•	Project Name: Intellisync Open Build
	•	Primary Folders:
	•	Intellisync-open-build/Ai-Build
	•	Intellisync-open-build/SocialNetwork-Build
	•	Project Goal:
	•	To build a personal AI using the OpenAI API, connecting to all endpoints. The AI model will feature capabilities such as:
	•	Speech-to-Text (STT)
	•	Text-to-Speech (TTS)
	•	File upload and handling
	•	Vision processing
	•	Code interpretation
	•	DALL-E 3 integration
	•	Web browsing
	•	The project will leverage OpenAI API documentation and code snippets as foundational resources.
	•	The build will be open-sourced as part of Intellisync’s strategy to promote AI integration.

Technology Stack:

	•	Framework: Vite (for fast builds and modern development environment)
	•	Frontend Library: React
	•	Additional Libraries: (To be determined based on specific component needs)
	•	API: OpenAI API
	•	Styling: CSS (with modular and individual component styles)
