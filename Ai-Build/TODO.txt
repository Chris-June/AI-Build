# Intellisync AI Build Project - To-Do List

## Project Goal:
To build an AI for personal use that will utilize the OpenAI API to connect to all endpoints. The AI model will have the following capabilities:
- Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- File upload
- Vision processing
- Code interpreter
- DALL-E 3 integration
- Web browsing

The project will use OpenAI API documentation and code snippet examples as the starting point. The build will be open-sourced as part of the companyâ€™s strategy to promote AI integration.

## Technology Stack:
- **Framework:** Vite (for fast builds and modern development environment)
- **Frontend Library:** React
- **Additional Libraries:** (To be determined based on component needs)
- **API:** OpenAI API
- **Styling:** CSS (with individual component styles)

## To-Do List:

### 1. **Initial Setup**
- [x] Set up Vite project with React.
- [x] Install necessary dependencies.
- [x] Create initial file structure.

### 2. **Core Features Development**
- [ ] Implement Speech-to-Text (STT) functionality using OpenAI API.

- [ ] Set up file upload functionality.
- [ ] Develop Vision processing features.
- [ ] Integrate the Code interpreter.
- [ ] Integrate DALL-E 3 for image generation.
- [ ] Enable web browsing capabilities.

### 3. **UI Components**
- [x] Set up basic shared components (Buttons, Forms, Inputs, etc.).
- [ ] Develop custom UI components for AI interactions.
- [ ] Implement chat interface for AI conversations.
- [ ] Build user profile and dashboard components.
- [ ] Ensure all components are responsive and accessible.

### 4. **API Integration**
- [ ] Connect to OpenAI API endpoints.
- [ ] Test and validate API integrations.
- [ ] Handle error states and edge cases in API interactions.

### 5. **Theming and Styling**
- [ ] Define global styles in `global.css`.
- [ ] Set up theme variables in the `styles/theme` directory.
- [ ] Apply consistent styling across all components.
- [ ] Implement dark and light mode themes.

### 6. **State Management**
- [ ] Implement custom hooks for managing state.
- [ ] Ensure state consistency across components.
- [ ] Integrate global state management (if needed).

### 7. **Testing and QA**
- [ ] Set up unit tests for components.
- [ ] Perform integration testing for API calls.
- [ ] Test responsive design on multiple devices.
- [ ] Conduct accessibility testing.

### 8. **Documentation**
- [ ] Write detailed documentation for each component.
- [ ] Update `README.md` with project details and usage instructions.
- [ ] Document API integration and usage.
- [ ] Create `storybook/` entries for UI components.

### 9. **Open Source Preparation**
- [ ] Review the codebase for open-source readiness.
- [ ] Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT License).
- [ ] Ensure all documentation is complete and clear.
- [ ] Publish the repository on GitHub.

### 10. **Deployment**
- [ ] Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- [ ] Deploy the application to a production environment.
- [ ] Monitor performance and make optimizations as needed.
