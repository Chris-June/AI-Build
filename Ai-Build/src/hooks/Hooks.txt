# Hooks Directory

## Purpose:
The `hooks` folder contains custom React hooks that encapsulate logic and state management across various parts of our AI-based web application. By centralizing complex and reusable logic into hooks, we can maintain a clean and modular codebase, promote reusability, and enhance the scalability of the application. This directory plays a crucial role in managing side effects, local storage, API calls, and more.

## Contents:
- **Custom Hooks:** Reusable hooks that handle specific functionalities, such as managing authentication, fetching data from APIs, storing data in local storage, and more. These hooks are designed to simplify component logic by abstracting complex tasks into easy-to-use functions.

- **State Management:** Hooks that manage state and side effects in a consistent and scalable way. This includes handling global state, managing local component state, and ensuring that state transitions are handled efficiently.

- **Utility Hooks:** Helper hooks that provide common functionalities like debouncing, throttling, and managing event listeners. These utility hooks are often used in multiple components and help keep the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

- **Instructional Guides:** Documents that explain the purpose and usage of each custom hook. These guides are designed to help learners and developers understand how to implement and extend hooks within their components, ensuring consistency and best practices across the application.

## How to Use:
1. **Explore Existing Hooks:** Review the custom hooks available in this directory to understand their purpose and functionality. Each hook is designed to be reusable and can be integrated into multiple components.

2. **Implement Hooks in Components:** When building new components, identify opportunities to use existing hooks to manage state, handle side effects, or interact with APIs. This will help keep your component logic clean and focused on UI concerns.

3. **Create New Hooks:** If you encounter repetitive logic or need to manage complex state, consider creating a new custom hook. Start by defining the hook's purpose and encapsulating the necessary logic. Ensure that your hook follows React best practices, such as using the `use` prefix and managing dependencies properly.

4. **Document Your Hooks:** When creating new hooks, include clear documentation within the `hooks` folder. This documentation should explain the hook's purpose, usage, and any specific considerations. This will help other developers understand how to use and extend the hook in their own work.

5. **Follow the Guides:** Refer to the instructional guides within this directory to ensure you're using hooks effectively and adhering to best practices. The guides will help you understand how to leverage hooks to improve the maintainability and scalability of your code.

6. **Contribute Back:** If you develop a new hook that could benefit the project, contribute it back to the `hooks` folder. This helps maintain a centralized approach to state management and logic handling across the application.

## Next Steps:
- Familiarize yourself with the current hooks and their use cases.
- Use the guides to help implement and extend hooks in your components.
- Consult your mentor or project lead if you need further clarification or assistance.

Enhance your application's scalability and maintainability with custom hooks!
