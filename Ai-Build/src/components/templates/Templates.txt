# Templates Directory

## Purpose:
The `templates` folder serves as a foundational guide for learners and developers who are building components and logic within our AI-based web application. This directory will hold template files and instructional documents that provide a starting point for creating new components, setting up state management, and implementing business logic.

## Contents:
- **Component Templates:** Boilerplate code for React components that include structure, basic state management, and prop validation. These templates are designed to be copied and modified according to the specific needs of the project.
  
- **Logic Templates:** Starter files that outline the logic required for common tasks within the application, such as API interactions, data processing, and utility functions. These templates are intended to be expanded upon and customized.

- **Instructional Guides:** Documents that explain the purpose of each template, how to use it, and best practices for building scalable and maintainable components. These guides are aimed at helping learners understand the architecture of the application and how to contribute effectively.

## How to Use:
1. **Start with a Template:** When building a new component or adding logic to the application, begin by copying the relevant template file from this directory. Rename the file to match your new component or logic's purpose.

2. **Customize the Template:** Modify the template to fit the specific needs of your feature or functionality. This may include adding new props, adjusting state management, or integrating with existing components and services.

3. **Follow the Guides:** Refer to the instructional guides within this folder to ensure you are following best practices and adhering to the application's architectural principles.

4. **Contribute Back:** If you create a new template or instructional guide that could benefit others, consider contributing it back to this directory for future learners and developers to use.

## Next Steps:
- Explore the existing templates to familiarize yourself with the available resources.
- Follow the guides to build your components and logic effectively.
- Reach out to your mentor or project lead if you have any questions or need further guidance.

Happy coding!
