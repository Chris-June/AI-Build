# Shared Components Directory

## Purpose:
The `shared` folder contains reusable UI components that are designed to be used across multiple parts of our AI-based web application. These components are the building blocks of the user interface, providing consistent design and functionality throughout the application. By centralizing common components here, we ensure that our application is modular, maintainable, and easy to extend.

## Contents:
- **Basic UI Elements:** Components like buttons, forms, inputs, and modals that are used throughout the application. These elements are designed to be highly reusable and customizable, allowing for consistent styling and behavior across different features.

- **Composite Components:** More complex components that combine multiple UI elements, such as cards, tables, and dropdowns. These components encapsulate common patterns and can be easily integrated into different pages and sections of the application.

- **Styling:** Each component in this directory comes with its own `.css` file, ensuring that styles are modular and can be easily maintained. This approach also allows for easy theme customization and consistent styling across the application.

- **Prop Validations:** Components in this folder often include prop validation using PropTypes, ensuring that they are used correctly and that the data passed to them is of the expected type. This improves the robustness of the application and helps prevent runtime errors.

- **Instructional Guides:** Documents that explain the purpose and usage of each shared component. These guides provide detailed instructions on how to integrate the components into various parts of the application, as well as best practices for customization and extension.

## How to Use:
1. **Explore Existing Components:** Review the components available in this directory to understand their structure and usage. These components are designed to be flexible and reusable across different parts of the application.

2. **Integrate Components:** When building new features, use the shared components to maintain consistency in design and behavior. These components can be easily integrated by importing them into your React components and passing the necessary props.

3. **Customize as Needed:** While the shared components are designed to be reusable, they can be customized by adjusting their props, styles, or structure. Ensure that any customizations are done in a way that maintains the component's reusability.

4. **Contribute Back:** If you create a new UI element that could be useful across multiple parts of the application, consider adding it to the `shared` folder. This helps keep the codebase organized and encourages the use of consistent patterns.

5. **Follow the Guides:** Refer to the instructional guides to ensure you're using the shared components effectively and adhering to best practices.

## Next Steps:
- Familiarize yourself with the shared components and their prop validations.
- Use the components in your feature development to maintain consistency across the application.
- Consult the guides for instructions on customization and integration.
- Contact your mentor or project lead if you need further clarification or assistance.

Keep your UI consistent and maintainable with shared components!
